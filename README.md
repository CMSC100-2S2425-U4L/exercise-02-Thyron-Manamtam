## Steps on how to create GitHub page: 
To create an optimized GitHub page, start by creating a new GitHub repository. After setting up the repository, build your website files, including index.html, style.css, and optionally script.js, ensuring the website is mobile-responsive and visually appealing. Push your files to GitHub using Git commands, then enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings by selecting the main branch as the source. To optimize your site, compress and use modern image formats like WebP, minify your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, leverage browser caching, and use a CDN for faster loading times. Ensure your design is mobile-first with responsive CSS or a framework like Bootstrap, and improve SEO by adding relevant meta tags for better search engine visibility and social sharing.
